            <h2><span class="icon-title">📦</span> INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>Glove Box commonly used in biology experiments to prevent the materials from leaking. The glove box I designed is aiming to create a environment for <span class="highlight-green">PFAS experiments</span> to prevent it from floating in the air and causing pollution.</p>

            <h2><span class="icon-title">❓</span> PROBLEM & SOLUTION</h2>
            <div class="future-text decorated-future-text">
                <h3><span class="icon-title">⚠️</span> Problem</h3>
                <p>We are doing a <span class="highlight-green">PFAS experiment</span> and PFAS can hurt the human body when it is in the air. As a result, we need a <span class="highlight-green">container</span> to do experiments in it in order to keep the harmful elements in it. Moreover, we only got about <span class="highlight-green">1000 RMB</span>, so we don’t have enough money to buy a glove box, and we need to make a glove box by ourselves instead.</p>
                <h3><span class="icon-title">💡</span> Solution</h3>
                <p>We decided to let me make a <span class="highlight-green">glove box</span>. The glove box should first be <span class="highlight-green">safe</span> and do not let the <span class="highlight-green">PFAS, PFOA and other harmful materials leak</span>. I need a <span class="highlight-green">transition chamber</span> to prevent leaking when delivering things into the glove box. I also need a <span class="highlight-green">cleaning device</span> to clean the glove box. I need some device to keep the glove box <span class="highlight-green">clean</span> to ensure that no other factors can affect the experiment. We will do the experiments in the glove box so that the harmful materials won’t get out.</p>

            <h2><span class="icon-title">🏗️</span> STRUCTURE DESIGN</h2>
            <div class="future-text decorated-future-text">
                <p>In order to make the main body of the glove box, I decided to use some <span class="highlight-green">transparent acrylic boards</span> to make the main body and the transition chamber. I will design the boards with holes and send it to the acrylic board custom manufacturers, and they will make the boards for me.</p>
                <p>A <span class="highlight-green">LED light strip</span> in the main body of the glove box is used to light up the box so the operator can do the experiment clearly.</p>
                <p>To make the environment in the glove box <span class="highlight-green">sterile</span>, a <span class="highlight-green">LED UV light strip</span> is needed to kill all bacteria to reduce factors that would affect the experiment.</p>
                <p>There will be an <span class="highlight-green">air pump</span> outside the glove box with a tube connected to its main body and it will pump the air out of the box and create a <span class="highlight-green">negative pressure environment</span> to prevent leaking.</p>
                <p><strong>Glove Box = Acrylic Boards + Electronic Devices + Tubes + Flange + Glove</strong></p>
                <p>Two holes are in the front of the glove box and two <span class="highlight-green">flanges</span> are attached to the hole with <span class="highlight-green">gloves</span> on them. Operators use gloves to do the experiment.</p>
                <p>A <span class="highlight-green">water pump</span> with tubes connected to the glove box can pump water into the glove box, and the tubes are connected to some nozzles in the glove box to spray water and clean the acrylic boards. Another water pump is connected to the bottom of the glove box so that it sucks out all the <span class="highlight-green">polluted water</span>.</p>
                <p>I will add a <span class="highlight-green">filter</span> to the other side of the air pump to prevent dust and other things from getting in and PFAS to get out.</p>
