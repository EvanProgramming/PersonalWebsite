                  <p>
                    <span class="icon-title">🔬</span> <strong>Background & Motivation</strong><br>
                    Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a persistent organic pollutant widely used in industrial and consumer products, such as non-stick cookware, stain-resistant fabrics, and firefighting foams. Its chemical stability and resistance to degradation have led to its accumulation in the environment, where it poses significant risks to both ecosystems and human health, including potential carcinogenicity and disruption of endocrine systems. Traditional methods for PFOA removal, such as activated carbon adsorption or advanced oxidation, are often costly, energy-intensive, and may generate secondary pollution. Recent advances in synthetic biology have enabled the engineering of blue algae capable of breaking down PFOA into less harmful substances, offering a promising, sustainable alternative. However, strict biosafety regulations prohibit the release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into natural environments, necessitating the development of a secure, closed-system hardware solution to safely utilize these engineered organisms for environmental remediation.

                    <span class="icon-title">🏠</span> <strong>Bioreactor Living Environment</strong><br>
                    The core of the reactor is a biocompatible chamber designed to mimic the natural habitat of blue algae. The system maintains optimal temperature, pH, and nutrient levels through automated feedback controls. Transparent, UV-resistant panels allow for maximum light penetration, while programmable LED arrays simulate natural sunlight cycles, supporting robust photosynthetic activity. The reactor is equipped with gentle mixing mechanisms to prevent sedimentation and ensure uniform distribution of nutrients and light. Gas exchange modules regulate CO₂ and O₂ concentrations, further optimizing growth conditions. The modular design allows for easy scaling, cleaning, and replacement of components, making the system adaptable for both laboratory research and industrial-scale applications.

                    <span class="icon-title">💧</span> <strong>Water Circulation & Containment</strong><br>
                    Water enters the reactor through a series of pre-filtration units that remove large particulates and potential contaminants. Inside the chamber, a continuous flow system ensures that PFOA-contaminated water is evenly exposed to the blue algae. All inlets and outlets are fitted with multi-stage filtration and sterilization units, including microfiltration membranes and UV sterilizers, to prevent any accidental release of blue algae or GMOs. The flow rate and residence time can be precisely controlled to maximize degradation efficiency. Effluent water is rigorously tested before discharge, ensuring that it meets environmental safety standards. The entire system is leak-proof, with secondary containment barriers and real-time leak detection sensors providing additional layers of safety.

                    <span class="icon-title">🧊</span> <strong>Crystal Collection System</strong><br>
                    As blue algae metabolize PFOA, the degradation process results in the formation of crystalline byproducts. The reactor features a conical bottom and a sedimentation zone where these crystals naturally settle. An automated collection arm periodically gathers the crystals and transfers them to a sealed collection chamber for safe storage and later analysis. The collection process is designed to minimize disturbance to the algae culture, maintaining system stability and continuous operation. The reactor can be equipped with sensors to monitor the accumulation of crystals, triggering maintenance alerts when necessary. This approach not only prevents environmental contamination but also enables the recovery and study of degradation byproducts, which may have further research or industrial value.

                    <span class="icon-title">🛡️</span> <strong>Safety & Monitoring</strong><br>
                    Safety is paramount in the reactor's design. The system is equipped with a comprehensive suite of sensors to monitor temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, light intensity, water flow, and pressure. All data are continuously logged and analyzed by an onboard microcontroller, which can trigger automated responses such as adjusting environmental parameters, activating emergency shutoff valves, or sending alerts to operators. The reactor is designed for remote monitoring and control, allowing researchers to oversee operations from a secure location. Maintenance ports and sampling valves are integrated into the design, enabling safe access for routine checks and sample collection without exposing the culture to the external environment. The entire system is constructed from chemically resistant, easy-to-sterilize materials to ensure long-term durability and biosafety compliance.

                    <span class="icon-title">🌱</span> <strong>Environmental Impact</strong><br>
                    By confining the blue algae and the entire degradation process within a closed, controlled environment, the reactor eliminates the risk of GMO escape and secondary pollution. The system is designed to be energy-efficient, utilizing low-power LED lighting and optimized flow dynamics to minimize operational costs. Treated water is thoroughly purified before release, ensuring that no harmful substances or organisms enter the natural environment. The modular, scalable design allows for deployment in a variety of settings, from laboratory research to industrial wastewater treatment plants. The reactor can be integrated with other water treatment technologies, such as activated carbon or membrane filtration, to provide a comprehensive solution for persistent organic pollutant removal.

                    <span class="icon-title">🔗</span> <strong>Future Directions</strong><br>
                    Looking ahead, the reactor platform can be further enhanced with advanced features such as real-time data analytics, machine learning-based process optimization, and full integration with cloud-based laboratory information management systems (LIMS). Additional modules could be developed to support the cultivation of other engineered microorganisms for the degradation of a wider range of pollutants, including pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and heavy metals. The system's open architecture allows for easy customization and expansion, supporting collaborative research and rapid prototyping of new bioremediation strategies. Educational and outreach versions of the reactor could be developed for use in schools and public science centers, raising awareness of synthetic biology and environmental protection. Ultimately, this hardware represents a significant step toward sustainable, safe, and effective biotechnological solutions for environmental challenges.

                    <span class="icon-title">⚠️</span> <strong>iGEM Safety Policy: Environmental Release Restrictions</strong><br>
                    According to the <a href="https://safety.igem.org/policy:release" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="igem-policy-link">iGEM Safety and Security Policy</a>, teams must not release genetically modified organisms (GMOs) or experimental products into the natural environment unless they have received explicit approval from the iGEM Safety Committee and relevant regulatory authorities. The policy states: <em>“iGEM teams must not release genetically modified organisms or products of synthetic biology into the environment as part of their project, unless they have received explicit permission from the iGEM Safety Committee and all relevant authorities.”</em> Teams are required to implement robust physical and biological containment strategies, conduct thorough risk assessments, and document all safety measures in their project reports. This reactor design fully complies with iGEM's requirements by providing a closed, controlled system that prevents any accidental release of blue algae or their genetic material, ensuring that all bioremediation activities are conducted safely and responsibly.
