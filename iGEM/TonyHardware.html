                    <span class="icon-title">🧰</span> <strong>Structure design</strong><br>
                    The bioreactor is a rectangle. The hardware use a special material that can let water in and keep the crystals made by degradation inside the bioreactor. The reactor is designed to be modular, allowing for easy scaling and adaptation to different experimental needs. The outer casing is made of a durable, chemically resistant polymer that can withstand the harsh conditions of bioremediation processes.

                    <span class="icon-title">♺</span> <strong>Metarial design</strong><br>
                    The material is a special polymer that is resistant to chemical degradation and can withstand the corrosive nature of PFOA and other persistent organic pollutants. The reactor's interior is lined with a biofilm-friendly surface that promotes the growth of blue algae while preventing the adhesion of contaminants. The design incorporates multiple layers of filtration and sterilization to ensure that no harmful substances escape into the environment. The outer layer is designed to be transparent to allow the water to get in, while the inner layer is designed to be opaque to prevent blue algae from escaping, and containing the crystals formed during the degradation process.

                    <span class="icon-title">⚠️</span> <strong>iGEM Safety Policy: Environmental Release Restrictions</strong><br>
                    According to the <a href="https://safety.igem.org/policy:release" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="igem-policy-link">iGEM Safety and Security Policy</a>, teams must not release genetically modified organisms (GMOs) or experimental products into the natural environment unless they have received explicit approval from the iGEM Safety Committee and relevant regulatory authorities. The policy states: <em>“iGEM teams must not release genetically modified organisms or products of synthetic biology into the environment as part of their project, unless they have received explicit permission from the iGEM Safety Committee and all relevant authorities.”</em> Teams are required to implement robust physical and biological containment strategies, conduct thorough risk assessments, and document all safety measures in their project reports. This reactor design fully complies with iGEM's requirements by providing a closed, controlled system that prevents any accidental release of blue algae or their genetic material, ensuring that all bioremediation activities are conducted safely and responsibly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <span class="icon-title">⨐</span>The bioreactor is designed to have functions like detecting PFOA in water, degrading PFOA, forming a multiple detection system, and collecting the degradation products. The reactor is equipped with sensors to monitor the concentration of PFOA in the water, allowing for real-time adjustments to optimize degradation efficiency. The blue algae culture is maintained under controlled conditions to ensure maximum metabolic activity, while the crystal collection system automates the harvesting of byproducts, minimizing manual intervention and potential contamination risks.
